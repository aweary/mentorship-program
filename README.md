# mentorship-program

The goal of this mentorship is to provide a tight-knit, responsive community for a rotating set of people who are underrepreseted in the tech world. This is an extension of the typical mentor/mentee programs, adopting the "it takes a village" approach to education and guidance.

## Outline

* The program will be hosted on a private Discord channel
* The Discord channel will have a set of rooms for different topics (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Ember, etc.)
* There will be a limited number of mentees to keep the program focused and manageable
* Mentees will be tentative invited for a predetermined amount of time (3-6 months maybe)
  * This will allow more people access to mentorship without making it unmanageable for the mentors
  * Progress can be reevaluated at the end of this rotational period, potentially alowing back-to-back rotations
* Mentees will be asked a set of basic questions before being invited, just to ensure that they'll actually get the most out of it
  * for example, if someone wants to learn Swift and we have no Swift mentors, it might not be the right fit for now
